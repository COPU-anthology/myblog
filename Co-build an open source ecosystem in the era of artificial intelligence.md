# Co-build an open source ecosystem in the era of artificial intelligence 
## Co-build artificial intelligence based on open source

(Report by COPU Honorary Chairman Lu Shouqun at the 20th Open Source China Open Source World Conference)

1. Huawei's innovative direction for enhancing computing power is mainly focused not on the manufacturing process of a single chip (which currently has shortcomings in low computing power and high power consumption), but on the innovative system architecture of chip integration: Huawei's CloudMatrix384 solution, developed with 384 910C chips, improves cluster efficiency by 67% through high-speed bus interconnection and memory pooling, providing a computing power of 300 PFLOPS, reaching a level comparable to that of NVIDIA's GB200 or H100 chip integration.

2. A batch of high-quality generative autoregressive language models has emerged. ① The Tongyi Qianwen Qwen3 mixed reasoning open-source large model developed by Alibaba's MoDa community features its flagship model Qwen3-235B-A22B along with 8 other large models, whose performance has temporarily surpassed DeepSeekR1 and OpenAIo1, officially reaching the top of the global open-source large model throne! ② The Xiaomi MiMo reasoning open-source large model, in the realm of lower parameters, MiMo-7B has surpassed OpenAIo1-mini and Alibaba's Qwen reasoning model QwQ-32B-Preview, showcasing its potential as a leading starting model in the industry for reinforcement learning.

3. The Super Agent CO-Sight developed by ZTE Corporation has topped the international authority Agent GAIA benchmark test, outperforming the four international giants: Google's DeepMind Langfun Agent, Microsoft (+OpenAI) Aworld, MIT's Infant Agent, and Meta's OWL-Workforce, ranking first! It has sparked the next wave of AI (the 'World Model').

4. The sixth generation semiconductor display's ultra-high pixel frontier technology and production line was developed by BOE, featuring ultra-high pixel density (2.24 inches with 1700 pixels), breaking existing strongholds, and establishing the world's most advanced sixth generation new semiconductor display device production line with mass production capabilities. 

5. COPU organized a dozen companies to develop AIOS. AIOS comes in two types: ① one that starts with applications to integrate intelligent modules into the OS, and ② one that starts with architecture or kernel to develop fully intelligent AIOS.

一、华为关于提升算力的创新方向，主要不放在单颗芯片的制造工艺上（目前单颗芯片存在算力低、功耗大的短板），而主要放在芯片集成的系统架构创新上：华为研发的华为云CloudMatrix384（用384颗910C芯片）算力集群解决方案，依靠高速总线互联和通过内存池化，提升集群效率67%，输出算力300PFLOPS，达英伟达GB200或H100同数芯片集成算力相当水平。

二、涌现出一批生成式自回归语言大模型精品①阿里魔搭社区开发的通义千问Qwen3混合推理开源大模型其旗舰模型为Qwen3-235B-A22B及8款大模型，其性能一度全面超越DeepSeekR1和OpenAIo1，正式登顶全球开源大模型王座！②小米Xiaomi MiMo推理开源大模型在较低参数领域，MiMo-7B超越了OpenAIo1-mini和阿里Qwen推理模型QwQ-32B-Preview，作为行业内强化学习的起步模型潜力领先。

三、超级智能体(Super Agent)中兴通讯（ZTE）研发的超级智能体CO-Sight，在通过国际权威的Agent GAIA基准测试中，力压国际四强：谷歌DeepMind的Langfun Agent、微软（+OpenAI）的Aworld、麻省理工学院（MlT）的lnfant Agent、Meta的/OWL-Workforce，排名榜首！掀起了AI的下一个浪潮（“世界模型”）。

四、第六代半导体显示器超高像素前沿技术和生产线京东方研制第六代半导体显示器超高像素前沿技术（超高像素密度：2.24英寸，1700个像素），打破了现有的王牌地位，并建成全球最先进的第六代新型半导体显示器件生产线，并可量产。

五、COPU组织十几家公司研发AIOS。AIOS有两种类型，①是以应用入手，在OS中加入智能模块，②是以架构或内核入手，研发全智能化的AIOS
